Skript Sprachen -- SS 2015 FH Ostfalia
===================
To my fellow Students:
 This are not complete Notes nor official approved (Prof or Ostfalia), so USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 If you have any questions just ask me in class or write me an email. (I'm the guy with the "funny" shoes -- fivefingers)
 The scripts should run under Linux, if they dont run under Windows let me know and I'll try to make them "portable".
